> ## Getting Started
>
> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
>
> Create nextjs project:
>
> ```bash
> npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/rezarinaldi/devscale-nextjs-template
> # at current folder
> npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/rezarinaldi/devscale-nextjs-template .
> ```
>
> Or click the button "Use this template", then click "Create a new repository". After that clone the repo:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/user/repo
> # or
> git clone git@github.com:user/repo
> # at current folder
> git clone https://github.com/user/repo .
> # or
> git clone git@github.com:user/repo .
> ```
>
> To install all dependencies of a project:
>
> ```bash
> npm install
> # or
> yarn
> # or
> pnpm install
> # or
> bun install
> ```
>
> Run the development server:
>
> ```bash
> npm run dev
> # or
> yarn dev
> # or
> pnpm dev
> # or
> bun dev
> ```
>
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
>
> You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
>
> This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
>
